1. a node module is code (usually a set of functions or other data) that can be inlcuded in your code.
2.the main difference between "exports" and "module.exports" is that you cannot reassign the object module.exports.
3. Using exports is recommended unless you inted on your module being a specific object type, due to the fact that `export`
is only a reference to `module.exports` and therefore cannot reassign the `module.exports` object.
